Questions:
    1. Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language?
        - Java is a pass by value programming language. 
        Arguments are passed as a copy of their value, not a reference to the original object or argument. 
        However, if an argument is an object reference, the copy of the reference points to the same object as the original reference, 
        which can sometimes cause confusion.
