Question: 
    If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?

Answer:
    Java allows you to create multiple constructor methods for a class, as long as they have different parameter lists.
In this case, you can create one constructor method that takes the title of the DVD as a parameter, 
and another constructor method that takes the category of the DVD as a parameter. 
The two constructor methods will have different parameter lists and therefore will be distinguishable from each other.
